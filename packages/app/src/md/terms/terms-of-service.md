## 2. How it works

1. Callsesh is a social freelancer platform that lets you create a User profile, which in turn allows you to:
   1. upload User Content to be viewed by other Users or Caller Interaction to be used by other Callers; and/or
   2. pay to call an Operator or view another User’s User Content or use another User’s Caller Interaction.

## 3. Account Registration

1. To become a User you must register and create a User Account on Callsesh. You must provide a valid phone number, a username, and other required personal information detailed the user registration form. It is a condition of your use of the Platform that all the information you provide on the Platform is correct, current, and complete.
2. You agree that all information you provide as a User or otherwise, including but not limited to information provided through the use of any interactive features on the Platform, is governed by Web Doodle’s Privacy Policy at [Privacy Policy](https://www.callsesh.com/terms/privacy-policy), and you proceed on the basis that you are aware of how and why Web Doodle process your personal data, as is set out in Web Doodle’s Privacy Policy.
3. If you wish to view User Content and make calls to an Operator, you will need to provide details of a payment card to a Payment Provider. Your payment card information is stored by the Payment Provider.
4. If you elect to input two or more payment card details onto your User Account if payment of the Revenue from the first card is rejected because the payment card is no longer valid then the other payment card(s) will be used to collect full payment of the Revenue. You must elect a default payment method which Web Doodle will use as the elected payment method.
5. If you are an Operator and wish to receive payment of Commissions, you will need to include onto your User Account Payout Options and upload a valid form of ID. You may also need to submit additional legal information, such as a W-9 if you are resident in the United States of America. The exact information required will depend on your country of residence. Amounts due to you as an Operator from Callers will be paid to you by one of our Payment Providers in accordance with your Payout Options. With the exception of Operators wishing to receive payment by direct bank transfer from Web Doodle, Web Doodle does not store any data disclosed by you when you register your Payout Options with the Payment Provider. Section 4 further describes the payment processes.
6. By registering on Callsesh, you confirm that:
   1. all User Account registration and profile information is truthful and accurate and that any User Content you provide is your own and does not infringe the intellectual property rights or any other proprietorial rights of a third party;
   2. if you previously had a User Account with Callsesh, your old User Account was not terminated or suspended by Web Doodle for violation of the Terms of Service;
   3. you register on Callsesh for your own personal use and you will not sell, rent or transfer your User Account to any third party; and
   4. Web Doodle reserve the right, at any time, to verify the information which you provide to Web Doodle as well as your compliance with the Terms. If Web Doodle is unable to verify this then Web Doodle reserve the right to suspend your account.

You also agree to ensure that you log out of your account at the end of each session. You should use particular caution when accessing your account from a public or shared computer so that others are not able to access, view or record your password or other personal information.

## 4. Subscriptions, Purchases and Payment of Revenue

1. Web Doodle will procure that Payment Providers ensure that Operators will receive the Commission from Web Doodle with the difference between the Revenue and Commission being the management fee (which will include Incentive Payments) levied by Web Doodle and payments due to the Payment Providers. The Commission will be 80% of the Revenue generated by Callers paying to view User Content uploaded by you or use Caller Interaction.
2. In order to view User Content or utilise Caller Interaction on OnlyCallers, you must first add a payment card to your account and then click the 'Subscribe' button on the relevant Operator’s profile. Your payment card details will be passed to a Payment Provider which will take payment from your payment card and pay it into Web Doodle’s account.
3. Depending on your use of Callsesh the Payment Provider will take monthly payments or will take payments for ad hoc purchases such as Caller Interaction. However, you may cancel the monthly payments at any time by turning off the 'Auto-Renew' switch located under the relevant Operator’s User Content profile or by contacting Web Doodle at support@callsesh.com. If you cancel your monthly payments you will continue to be permitted to view the Operator's User Content until the end of the existing billing period, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Operator’s User Content.
4. Web Doodle receives the Revenue and holds the Commission on behalf of the relevant Operator, and not on your behalf as a Caller. Once Web Doodle has received payment from you as a Caller you have no further liability to the relevant Operator and the Operator shall allow you as a Caller to view the User Content or utilise Caller Interaction.
5. Web Doodle will take payment of the Revenue from the Caller and hold the Commission in Web Doodle’s capacity as the agent for the Operator. A pre-authorisation is authorised on the Operator's behalf to ensure the validity of the Caller User's provided Payment Options. Caller Interaction charges are then calculated and captured at the end of the Caller Interaction. The Caller permits Web Doodle to charge the provided Payment Options until outstanding balances are settled. In the case of Caller insufficient funds, Web Doodle can prevent further Caller Interaction until outstanding balances are settled.
6. All payments to view User Content or utilise Caller Interaction are final and non-refundable. If Web Doodle is alerted that a Caller has sought and received a Refund or Chargeback, Web Doodle will take additional actions. Any purchase of the right to view User Content or to use Caller Interaction which is subsequently subject to a Refund or Chargeback may result in the User’s account being immediately and permanently excluded from Callsesh. The Refund or Chargeback amount may be removed from the earning Operator's income. The Operator may be alerted to the Caller Refund or Chargeback.

## 5. Account Deactivation

1. Should you wish to deactivate your Callsesh membership then you may do so in your User Account section or by contacting support@callsesh.com and proceeding with an email based phone number verification.
2. If you are a Caller then any account deactivation will take place as soon as reasonably possible. You will no longer be charged or have access to Operator User Content or Caller Interaction. Any subscriptions will be deleted and cannot be subsequently renewed.
3. If you are an Operator then you can only deactivate your membership when your last Caller Interaction and/or Caller Subscription has expired, and you have withdrawn any balance on your account.
4. If a User is both an Operator and a Caller then the account will be deactivated in two stages (Caller and then Operator).
5. You will receive an email confirmation upon the successful deletion of your account.
