## The Privacy Policy

### Introduction

Callsesh is a social freelancer website and application service which enables users to share their content; other users to enjoy content and for some to do both. We refer to those users who provide a freelance operation as “Operators” and those users who pay for the said freelance operation or Operators’ content as “Callers”. Both Callers and Operators provide content typically in the form of voice content to conduct a phone call, but in other circumstances, user profiles can be built using profile pictures, profile names, and other related data. Most of this policy relates to all users but where necessary we differentiate between Callers and Operators.

Callsesh is the trading and product name of Web Doodle (ABN 25 170 816 247).

When people use Callsesh, they share some information with us. This policy sets out the information we collect, how we use it and who we share it with.

We confirm that the lawful basis for processing your data is that by participating with our social freelancer platform you have contracted with us and the processing of data set out here is part of that contract. The contract is the Terms of Service to which all users are a party. To the extent that we have to monitor and control the use of our site which includes the content submitted, the User who submitted it and the User who accessed the content the basis for that processing is to fulfil a legal obligation.

If you have any questions about anything in our Privacy Policy or wish to complain then please contact support@callsesh.com. We hope that we can resolve any query or concern you raise about our use of your information.

### Payment Providers

The volume of payments made by Callers to access content, payments made to Operators for their content and where Users reside means that we use third party payment providers. This involves the transfer of personal data being names and bank details.
When Callers make payments these are processed through third party processors. You will contract with those third parties which will be the data controller of that data.
When we receive the monies, we remit the balance to the Operators, minus management fees. The Operator will either:

- contract with the third party processor. We use a number of third party processors; or
- be paid by us – if this happens the Operator enters their banking information and in some circumstances, their governmental identification details – each bank and jurisdiction has its own requirements onto our platform. We then arrange for payment.

### Third-party content and integrations

At present we do not offer these.

### Analytics and advertising services

We do not let other companies collect information about how you use our services.

### How long we keep your content

Operator Content:
We want you to be in control of your information. At any time an Operator can delete any content the Operator choses to. To the extent content contains pictures, footage or your voice, this is personal data.

Caller Content:
To the extent content contains your voice, this is personal data. At any time a Caller can delete any content that they have submitted to Callsesh.

Other Personal Data:
If any User closes the account the personal data that relates to your use of Callsesh and bank details we hold about you will be deleted after six months.

Web Doodle has to retain financial information for 7 years. This is a legal requirement as governmental bodies can investigate our financial records for that period and we need to retain details of payments made by you and to you.
